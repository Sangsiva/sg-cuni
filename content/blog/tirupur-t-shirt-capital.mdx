## The City That Clothes the World

If you've ever worn a cotton t-shirt, there's a good chance it came from Tirupur. This city in Tamil Nadu, India, produces over **$5 billion worth of knitwear annually**, exporting to brands and retailers across Europe, the US, and Asia.

But what makes Tirupur special — and why does it matter for your Singapore uniform order?

## A Century of Garment Expertise

Tirupur's textile industry dates back to the 1920s. Over a century of specialisation has created:

- **Deep supply chains** — Raw cotton sourcing, spinning, dyeing, cutting, stitching, and finishing all happen within a 50km radius
- **Skilled workforce** — Generations of garment workers with expertise in every type of knitwear
- **Quality infrastructure** — Modern factories with international certifications (ISO, GOTS, Oeko-Tex)
- **Competitive pricing** — Vertical integration and scale keep costs low without sacrificing quality

## By the Numbers

Tirupur's garment cluster is staggering in scale:

- **6,000+ garment units** ranging from small workshops to large export houses
- **600,000+ workers** employed directly in the textile industry
- **Exports to 100+ countries** including major brands you'd recognise
- **50% of India's total knitwear exports** originate from Tirupur

This scale means suppliers have access to every fabric, every printing technique, and every finishing method — all at competitive prices.

## How This Benefits Your Singapore Order

When you order uniforms through SG Corp Uniforms, you're tapping directly into this ecosystem. Here's what that means for you:

### 1. Better Pricing

By sourcing directly from Tirupur, we cut out the middlemen. A polo shirt that might cost $20-25 through a local Singapore supplier can cost **$12-15 through us** — with the same or better quality.

### 2. More Options

Need a specific fabric weight? A particular blend? An unusual colour? Tirupur's extensive supply chain means we can source virtually any material specification. No "sorry, we don't carry that."

### 3. Consistent Quality

Our production partner has been operating in Tirupur for years, serving corporate clients with strict quality requirements. Every order goes through multi-point quality checks before shipping.

### 4. Scalability

Whether you need 50 pieces or 5,000, the capacity is there. Tirupur's factories can scale production without compromising quality or timelines.

## The SG Corp Bridge

The challenge with ordering directly from India has always been the communication gap, quality assurance, and logistics complexity. That's where we come in.

**We handle everything from Singapore:**
- Consultation and design in your timezone
- Quality control with photo verification before shipping
- Customs documentation and tracked shipping
- SGD invoicing with local payment options
