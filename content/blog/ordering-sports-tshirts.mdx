## Planning Your Company Event Apparel

Whether it's an annual sports day, a charity run, or a team-building retreat, custom sports t-shirts bring your team together and make the event memorable.

Here's a step-by-step guide to getting it right.

## Step 1: Choose the Right Fabric

For sports and events in Singapore's climate, fabric choice is critical.

**Dri-fit / Moisture-wicking** is the top choice for active events. It pulls sweat away from the body and dries quickly. Perfect for outdoor activities, runs, and sports days.

**CoolMax blends** offer enhanced breathability for intense activities. They're slightly more premium but worth it for marathon events or outdoor tournaments.

**Avoid 100% cotton** for active events — it absorbs sweat and becomes heavy and uncomfortable in Singapore's humidity.

## Step 2: Design for Impact

Sports t-shirts are a chance to be bold with your branding.

- **Full-colour sublimation** allows all-over prints with no colour limitations
- **Screen printing** is cost-effective for simple designs with 1-3 colours
- **DTF (Direct-to-Film)** printing handles complex designs with photographic detail

For sports day, consider adding **team names, player numbers, or department labels** to create a sense of competition and belonging.

## Step 3: Plan Your Sizes

Sports t-shirts should fit comfortably for movement. Here's our sizing advice:

- Order a **range of sizes** from XS to 3XL
- For mixed teams, a good default ratio is: 10% XS, 20% S, 30% M, 25% L, 10% XL, 5% 2XL+
- Always order **5-10% extra** in popular sizes (M and L) for last-minute additions
- Consider offering both **men's and women's cuts** for better fit

## Step 4: Timeline and Quantities

For company events, plan ahead:

| Order Size | Production Time | Recommended Lead Time |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| 50-100 pcs | 7-10 days | 3 weeks before event |
| 100-300 pcs | 10-14 days | 4 weeks before event |
| 300+ pcs | 14-21 days | 5-6 weeks before event |

**Pro tip:** If you're ordering for an annual event, place your order at least 4 weeks in advance. Rush orders are possible but may incur additional costs.

## Step 5: Budget Planning

Sports t-shirts are one of the most affordable uniform options:

- **Basic dri-fit with 1-colour print:** From $8/pc
- **Premium dri-fit with full-colour sublimation:** From $12/pc
- **CoolMax with custom design:** From $14/pc

Prices decrease with higher quantities. For 300+ pieces, you can expect significant savings per unit.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Ordering too late** — Singapore shipping takes 3-7 days after production
2. **Ignoring fabric weight** — Lighter GSM (120-150) is better for active events
3. **Complex designs on dark fabrics** — Some printing methods don't work well on dark colours
4. **Not ordering extras** — Always have spare t-shirts for unexpected participants
