## Why Fabric Choice Matters in Singapore

Singapore's tropical climate — with average temperatures of 31°C and humidity often exceeding 80% — makes fabric selection critical for corporate uniforms. The wrong fabric can lead to discomfort, excessive sweating, and a less-than-professional appearance by midday.

## Top Fabric Options for Singapore

### 1. Cotton (100%)

**Best for:** Casual office environments, company events

Cotton is breathable, soft, and comfortable against the skin. It absorbs moisture well, making it a natural choice for hot weather. However, pure cotton wrinkles easily and takes longer to dry.

- **Weight:** 160-200 GSM for T-shirts, 200-240 GSM for polos
- **Care:** Machine washable, may shrink slightly on first wash
- **Price range:** Budget-friendly

### 2. Poly-Cotton Blend (65/35 or 60/40)

**Best for:** Daily office wear, corporate polos

The most popular choice for corporate uniforms in Singapore. Poly-cotton combines the comfort of cotton with the durability and wrinkle resistance of polyester. It maintains shape better through repeated washing.

- **Weight:** 180-220 GSM
- **Care:** Easy maintenance, retains color well
- **Price range:** Mid-range

### 3. Dri-Fit / Moisture-Wicking

**Best for:** Outdoor events, sports days, active roles

These performance fabrics actively pull moisture away from the body. Ideal for staff who are on their feet, working outdoors, or for company sporting events.

- **Weight:** 130-170 GSM
- **Care:** Quick-drying, minimal ironing needed
- **Price range:** Slightly higher

### 4. CoolMax / Performance Blends

**Best for:** Premium corporate wear, client-facing roles

Advanced fabric technology that combines professional appearance with maximum comfort. These fabrics offer UV protection, anti-bacterial properties, and superior moisture management.

- **Weight:** 150-200 GSM
- **Care:** Retain properties through many wash cycles
- **Price range:** Premium

## Making Your Decision

Consider these factors:

1. **Work environment** — Air-conditioned office vs outdoor work
2. **Activity level** — Desk-based vs physically active roles
3. **Brand image** — Casual startup vs formal corporate
4. **Budget** — Per-piece cost for your order volume
5. **Maintenance** — Who washes the uniforms and how often

## Our Recommendation

For most Singapore corporate environments, we recommend **poly-cotton blend (65/35)** as the sweet spot between comfort, durability, and cost. For sports events and outdoor activities, **dri-fit fabrics** are the clear winner.
