## The Great Debate: Polos or T-Shirts?

When ordering custom uniforms for your Singapore team, the first decision is often the simplest — and the hardest. Should you go with polo shirts or t-shirts?

Both are excellent choices, but they serve different purposes. Here's how to decide.

## When to Choose Polo Shirts

Polo shirts strike the perfect balance between professional and comfortable. They're ideal for:

- **Client-facing roles** — The collar gives a polished, business-casual look
- **Hospitality and retail** — Hotels, restaurants, and shops where appearance matters
- **Daily office wear** — Comfortable enough for all-day wear, smart enough for meetings
- **Corporate events** — Company retreats, trade shows, and conferences

Polo shirts work best with **embroidered logos**, which gives a premium, long-lasting finish. Expect to pay around **$12–15 per piece** for quality polos with embroidery.

## When to Choose T-Shirts

T-shirts are versatile, affordable, and comfortable. They're the go-to for:

- **Casual office environments** — Tech startups, creative agencies, co-working spaces
- **Sports days and events** — Company runs, team-building activities, charity events
- **Warehouse and production teams** — Where comfort and movement matter most
- **Marketing and giveaways** — Brand merchandise, event freebies

T-shirts support **screen printing, DTF printing, and sublimation**, making them perfect for full-colour, vibrant designs. Starting from around **$8 per piece**, they're also more budget-friendly.
