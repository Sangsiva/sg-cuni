## Getting Your Uniform Order Right the First Time

Ordering custom uniforms for your team is a significant investment. Whether you're a startup ordering your first batch or an established company refreshing your brand, these five considerations will help you avoid costly mistakes.

## 1. Start with Your Use Case, Not Your Budget

Before looking at prices, clearly define how the uniforms will be used:

- **Daily office wear?** Prioritise comfort and durability — poly-cotton polos or cotton t-shirts that can handle frequent washing
- **Client-facing roles?** Invest in premium fabrics and embroidered branding for a professional finish
- **Outdoor or active work?** Dri-fit and moisture-wicking fabrics are essential in Singapore's climate
- **One-off events?** Budget-friendly options with screen printing work perfectly

Your use case determines the fabric, branding method, and quality level — which then determines the price. Starting with a budget often leads to compromises in the wrong areas.

## 2. Get Your Sizing Right

Sizing issues are the number one cause of dissatisfaction with bulk uniform orders. Here's how to avoid problems:

- **Collect individual size measurements** rather than relying on "standard" sizes — sizing varies between manufacturers
- **Request a size chart** from your supplier before placing the order
- **Order size samples first** if possible — a small upfront investment saves major headaches
- **Include a buffer** of 5-10% extra in the most common sizes (M, L) for new joiners and replacements

## 3. Choose the Right Branding Method

Each printing/branding method has pros and cons:

**Embroidery** — Best for logos on polos and formal wear. Durable, premium look. Higher cost per unit but lasts the lifetime of the garment.

**Screen printing** — Best for simple designs with 1-3 colours. Very cost-effective for large quantities. Not ideal for complex, multi-colour designs.

**DTF (Direct-to-Film)** — Best for complex, full-colour designs. Good for medium quantities. Handles photographic detail well.

**Sublimation** — Best for all-over prints on light-coloured polyester fabrics. Popular for sports jerseys and event tees.

**Our recommendation:** For most corporate uniforms, embroidery for the chest logo and screen printing for any back design offers the best combination of quality and value.

## 4. Plan Your Timeline

Production timelines in Singapore's custom uniform industry typically look like this:

- **Design and mockup:** 1-3 days
- **Production:** 7-14 days (depending on quantity and complexity)
- **Shipping to Singapore:** 3-7 days
- **Total:** 2-4 weeks from approval to delivery

**Key tips:**
- Start the process at least 4 weeks before you need the uniforms
- Factor in revision time — your first mockup might need adjustments
- Avoid peak seasons (December-January, Chinese New Year period) when production capacity is limited

## 5. Think Beyond the First Order

Your uniform supplier should be a long-term partner, not a one-time vendor. Consider:

- **Reorder capability** — Can they reproduce the exact same uniform for new employees?
- **Colour consistency** — Do they keep records of Pantone codes and fabric specifications?
- **Small top-up orders** — Can they handle orders of 20-30 pieces for new hires, or only large batches?
- **Design updates** — If your branding evolves, can they adapt existing uniform designs?

At SG Corp Uniforms, we maintain records of every order — fabric specifications, colour codes, sizing details — so reorders are seamless and consistent.
