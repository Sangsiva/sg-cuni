For your current stage:
	1.	Buy your domain (e.g. abc.com).
	2.	Verify that domain in Resend (add DNS records they give you).
	3.	Use Option A:
	•	from: 'enquiry@abc.com'
	•	to: 'your_gmail@gmail.com'
	•	reply_to: 'your_gmail@gmail.com'
	4.	Later, when you want more “official” email, add forwarding or Google Workspace.
