1.  Add real proof: photos, logos, and story

This is the single biggest upgrade.

Portfolio page
	•	Get 5–10 good photos from your relative:
	•	Corporate polos
	•	Event T-shirts
	•	Uniform sets (office, factory, F&B)
	•	On /portfolio, replace placeholders with real images grouped by category.
	•	Even if you blur logos or crop faces, real fabric & printing instantly builds trust.

Home “proof” section

Under “Why Choose Us?”, add a simple row:
	•	“Trusted by teams in: [City1, City2, City3]”
or
	•	Small text: “Supplying uniforms for SMEs and growing businesses in Singapore and India since YYYY.”

About section

Add 3–4 lines of human story:
	•	Who you are (SG-based, relative in Tirupur),
	•	Years of experience on the production side,
	•	Typical daily/weekly capacity.
